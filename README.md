The goal of the application is to help teachers and admins predict and track student performance based on courses, attendance, and test scores. I implemented role-based 
authentication so that both students and admins have secure and appropriate access. Admins can manage courses, student records, and performance data, while students
can log in to view their personal profiles, performance scores, and predicted outcomes. The system also supports historical performance tracking, allowing students to view
past results and predictions in a chronological format.
